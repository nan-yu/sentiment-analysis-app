## Development flow

1. Create a Node.js project

```bash
cd genkit
npm init
```

2. Install TypeScript

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

3. Create `tsconfig.json`

```bash
npx tsc --init --project . # local installation of typescript
tsc --init --project . # global installation of typescript
```

4. Create source files

```bash
mkdir src
touch src/index.ts
```

5. Write TypeScript code

63. Add dependencies

```bash
npm install genkit @genkit-ai/googleai
```

7. Run the TypeScript compiler

```bash
npx tsc # local installation of typescript
tsc # global installation of typescript
```

8. Run the Genkit flow locally

```bash
tsc && genkit start -- node lib/index.js  # Run from the compiled JavaScript
genkit start -- tsx --watch src/index.ts  # Run from the TypeScript source code
```

9. Send requests to the local Genkit flow

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3400/analyzeFlow -d '{"data": {"topic": "Taylor Swift"}}'
```

10. Deploy the Genkit flow to Google Cloud

```bash
$ cd genkit && ./deploy.sh

## Installation issues

1. `genkit` command not found

**Issue**: Using `npm install -g genkit` got a command not found error.
It turns out genkit@0.9.0 cannot be used as a CLI: https://github.com/firebase/genkit/issues/1295.

**Fix**: use `npm install -g -D genkit-cli` for installation.

**Triage**

```bash
$ ls $(npm config get prefix)/bin
corepack firebase node     npm      npx      tsc      tsserver

$ npm explore -g genkit -- ls -l

```

The package doesn't have a `bin` folder and `package.json` doesn't have a `bin` field.

2. `genkit flow:run` returns a `spawn tsx ENOENT` error

**Issue**:  Running `genkit flow:run ....` returns `Error in app process: Error: spawn tsx ENOENT`.
The Genkit process tries to use the `tsx` command to execute the TypeScript flow, but it can't find it.

**Fix**: Install `tsx`.

```bash
$ npm install -g tsx

changed 5 packages in 996ms

2 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details
$ tsx --version
tsx v4.19.2
node v22.13.0
```

3. Prompt error

There's no objective truth to \"positive\" or \"negative\" aspects of a person.\n* **Bias:**  Creating such lists would inevitably reflect my own biases and opinions, which wouldn't be a fair or accurate representation of Taylor Swift. \n* **Oversimplification:**  Taylor Swift is a complex individual with a multifaceted career.

[error] Error: Error retrieving LLM response.

**Fix**:

Avoid mentioning sentiment analysis keywords in the prompt.

4. Missing schema

**Issue**: [error] Error: Error retrieving LLM response.

**Fix**: 

```typescript
const inputSchema = ai.defineSchema("analyzeRequestSchema", analyzeRequestSchema);
const outputSchema = ai.defineSchema("analyzeResponseSchema", analyzeResponseSchema);
```
